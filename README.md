# 📡 Aerograph – Subgraph for The Graph Protocol

**Aerograph** is a subgraph built for indexing and querying data from a specific smart contract or protocol using [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/). It provides a GraphQL API to fetch structured, real-time data efficiently.

---

## 🧠 What is The Graph?

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data using GraphQL. Subgraphs define how data is ingested, stored, and served from Ethereum and other networks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Code Generation

Generates types from the GraphQL schema and ABIs:

```bash
yarn codegen
```

### 3. Build the Subgraph

```bash
yarn build
```

### 4. Deploy to The Graph Hosted Service

Update `subgraph.yaml` with your contract address and start block, then:

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service <YOUR_DEPLOY_KEY>
graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USERNAME>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```

> 🔐 You can get a deploy key from [https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard)

## 📄 Files Explained

| File             | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `subgraph.yaml`  | Manifest file defining data sources, schema, and mappings              |
| `schema.graphql` | GraphQL schema for your subgraph                                       |
| `src/`           | Contains mapping handlers (e.g., `handleTransfer`, `handleMint`, etc.) |
| `abis/`          | Contract ABIs used by the subgraph                                     |

---

## 🧪 Testing

To run mapping logic tests:

```bash
yarn test
```
